# Solo Practice Questions (IS 303)

This repository contains Python practice problems designed for BYU's IS 303 class. Use these resources to prepare **before class** or to get extra practice with specific topics.

## Repository Structure:

- **`concepts-and-syntax`**:
    - Brief overview and simple practice sections to introduce chapter concepts before class.
    - AI review prompts to help solidify your understanding.

- **`practice`** and **`solutions`**:
    - Organized by topic/chapter.
    - Each problem has two files:
        - `_practice_`: Instructions and optional AI guidance prompt.
        - `_solution_`: One possible solution.

## Recommended Use:

1. **Before class**, start by reading through the brief overviews in the `concepts-and-syntax` folder and attempt each of the "You Try" sections.
2. Next, pick at least one practice problem from the `practice` folder:
    - Problems are generally ordered by difficulty (easiest first).
    - Try solving without help first.
3. If you're stuck or unsure:
    - Copy and paste the provided **AI prompt** and **instructions** into your preferred AI chatbot (ChatGPT, Gemini, Copilot, etc.) for step-by-step guidance.
4. After getting help, attempt the problem again independently for deeper learning.

Consistently doing this practice will ensure you're well-prepared for class and reinforce your Python programming skills.
